*Course Description:*
Held in Heidelberg, Germany, this three-week course emphasizes interaction with MR scientists and instrumentation at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and the [German Cancer Research Center](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html). Approximately 40% of the course time will be direct instruction on MR and 40% will consist of visits to instrumentation facilities and labs to discuss current applications in MR. This course does not contain an instructional lab component. (That is, unlike CHEM 103L for example, students will not directly conduct experiments written in a lab manual. Rather, the lab experiences in this course will be guided under the supervision of faculty.) Approximately 10% of the course will focus on historical developments, both of MR and of regional science. (The remainder of the course time is set aside for final presentations.)
