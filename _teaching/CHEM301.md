*Course Description:*
This course is intended for chemistry majors. In it, we will discuss principles and postulates of quantum mechanics and will develop simple quantum mechanical models that lead to an understanding of real molecules. We will review mathematical principles necessary to understand quantum mechanics, and we will discuss principles of atomic and molecular spectroscopy. Lastly, we will preview principles of chemical kinetics. The content of CHEM 301 will be used heavily in CHEM 302.
