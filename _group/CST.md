bestpart: "The best part about the Meldrum Lab is most definitely the people.  My favorite thing is Friday group meetings because everyone always has so much energy and brings such varied ideas and perspectives to the table.  For example, I can never stop laughing at the beginning of group meeting as we do our ‘roses and thorns’ of the week where I get a glimpse into the lives of my peers.  Their triumphs and tribulations always somehow make me laugh."
rightnow: "In the Spring I plan to continue collecting interface data for the epoxy samples and doing whatever else needs to be done."
