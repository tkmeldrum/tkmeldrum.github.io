Tyler is keenly aware of the importance of exposure to science at an early age. His wife, Sara, is a youth service librarian at the [Williamsburg Regional Library;](https://www.wrl.org) together, they design and present programs to help children understand science and, more importantly, get excited about it. Below are some of the programs that they have done together.

## Light and Color (first presented 8 April 2015)
We see things because light bounces off of things and comes to us. But what is light really?
Light is a wave, and properties of the wave tell us about the color and brightness of the light. (Make waves using a jumprope.)
Sometimes, the colors that we see are made up of lots of other colors. (Use diffraction gratings to see rainbow. Then, look at a hydrogen lamp to see that there are only lines of light, not a regular rainbow.)
In addition to what we can see, there are many different colors we cannot see. Like x-rays, infrared (show the light from a TV remote using the cameras on cell phones), and radio.
There is also “black light,” also called ultraviolet light. It can make things glow (show laundry detergent under black light).

**Craft:** painting with black light paint.

## Energy and You! (first presented 30 July 2016)
A brief introduction to the idea of conservation of energy, both in the thermodynamic sense and in the saving energy sense.

**Craft:** Using conductive dough (see [Squishy Circuits](http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/buildingCircuits.htm)), make an LED light up using aluminum and copper wire.
