Tyler values exposure to science at an early age. As *Professor Tyler,* he designs programs that he presents at the [Williamsburg Regional Library;](https://www.wrl.org) these programs help children understand science and, more importantly, get excited about it. Some of his programs include:

## Light and Color
*April 2015*

We see things because light bounces off of things and comes to us. But what is light really?
Light is a wave, and properties of the wave tell us about the color and brightness of the light. (Make waves using a jumprope.)
Sometimes, the colors that we see are made up of lots of other colors. (Use diffraction gratings to see rainbow. Then, look at a hydrogen lamp to see that there are only lines of light, not a regular rainbow.)
In addition to what we can see, there are many different colors we cannot see. Like x-rays, infrared (show the light from a TV remote using the cameras on cell phones), and radio.
There is also “black light,” also called ultraviolet light. It can make things glow (show laundry detergent under black light).

**Read:** *On a Beam of Light: A Story of Albert Einstein* by Jennifer Berne

**Craft:** painting with black light paint

## Energy and You!
*July 2016*

A brief introduction to the idea of conservation of energy, both in the thermodynamic sense and in the saving energy sense.

**Read:** *When Charlie McButton Lost Power* by Suzanne Collins

**Craft:** Using conductive dough (see [Squishy Circuits](http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/buildingCircuits.htm)), make an LED light up using aluminum and copper wire.

## Thankful for Chemistry
*November 2018*

Leaves changing colors turn into an overview of chromatography, candy pumpkins become atoms in molecular modeling kits, and kids practice good lab skills with lab notebook mad libs! Two hour-long presentations on chemistry and its connection to fall and Thanksgiving, together with two hours of open activities for kids ages five and up.

## Simmer and Sear: Heat, Chemistry, and Cooking
*an evening program for adults, June 2018*
