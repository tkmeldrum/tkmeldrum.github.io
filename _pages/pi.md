Raised in colorful Colorado, Tyler has been a member of the Department of Chemistry at William & Mary (Williamsburg, Virginia, USA) since 2013. Prior to his appointment there, he completed his B.S. in Biochemistry at Brigham Young University and his Ph.D. in Chemistry with [Prof. Alexander Pines at the University of California, Berkeley](https://pines.berkeley.edu/) (2011). His graduate research focused on developing molecular sensors that respond to small perturbations in the local chemical environment and which report those perturbations via the chemical shift of xenon in the NMR spectrum. Following his Ph.D. he was awarded an [Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/) with which he worked in the laboratory of Prof. Bernhard Bl√ºmich at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.itmc.rwth-aachen.de/) in Aachen, Germany. There he adapted his NMR experience from large, superconducting magnets to small, handheld arrays of permanent magnets with which large objects can be analyzed. His research there took him across much of Europe, studying forged paintings, ruins of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, and bones from centuries-old burial sites, among others. Tyler loves biking and coffee. He and his wife, Sara, love music, food, and raising two wonderful daughters.
