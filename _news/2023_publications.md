The Meldrum Lab has published two new papers this spring, both featuring student authors! The first, _[Automated optimization of spatial resolution for single-sided NMR](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrc.5352)_, addresses how we can improve spatial resolution of MR measurements by co-aligning magnet and sample. The second, _[Characterization of molecular environments and chemical exchange in acrylic paints via single-sided NMR](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.porgcoat.2023.107770),_ explores the relationship between pigment, binder, and chemical exchange in acrylic paints. Congratulations!
