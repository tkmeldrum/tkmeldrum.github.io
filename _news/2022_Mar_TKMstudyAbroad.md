Tyler was accepted to create and direct a short-term study abroad program in Heidelberg, Germany! His course, _Bio/Molecular Imaging,_ held in January 2023, will focus on NMR and MRI as tools to study anatomical and biomolecular structure. He's long wanted to take students abroad and is thrilled for this opportunity!
