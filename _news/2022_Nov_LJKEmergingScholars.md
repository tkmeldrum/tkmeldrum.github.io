Lyndi gave a wonderful presentation today, "Understading the Chemistry of Paint for Art Conservation." Her talk was part of the [Emerging Scholars Series](https://www.wm.edu/as/graduate/graduate-center/public-scholarship-initiative/ess-series/index.php), a partnership between William & Mary and the Williamsburg Regional Library. She connected strongly and clearly with the audience who brought excellent and relevant questions up at the end. Congratulations on a successful talk, Lyndi!
