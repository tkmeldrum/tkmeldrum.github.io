Leaves changing colors turn into an overview of chromatography, candy pumpkins become atoms in molecular modeling kits, and kids practice good lab skills with [lab notebook mad libs (pdf)](/files/LabNotebookMadLibs.pdf)! Two hour-long presentations on chemistry and its connection to fall and Thanksgiving, together with two hours of open activities for kids ages five and up.
