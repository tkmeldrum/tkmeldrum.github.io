We measure relaxation properties of materials using single-sided NMR. Transverse nuclear relaxation is a property that arises from the interaction of different atomic nuclei in a given sample. Materials with strong internuclear coupling (i.e., rigid materials, small internuclear distances) will exhibit rapid transverse relaxation, while materials with weak internuclear couplings will show slow relaxation. Thus, the rate of relaxation can be correlated with the degree of molecular coupling, suggesting physical properties of the sample including age, rigidity, cross-linking, etc. Interpreting these relaxation properties informs our understanding of several types of materials.
